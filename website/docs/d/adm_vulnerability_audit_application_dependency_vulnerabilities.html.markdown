# Data Source: oci_adm_vulnerability_audit_application_dependency_vulnerabilities
This data source provides the list of Vulnerability Audit Application Dependency Vulnerabilities in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure ADM service.

Returns a list of Application Dependencies with their associated vulnerabilities.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_adm_vulnerability_audit_application_dependency_vulnerabilities" "test_vulnerability_audit_application_dependency_vulnerabilities" {
	#Required
	vulnerability_audit_id = oci_adm_vulnerability_audit.test_vulnerability_audit.id

	#Optional
	cvss_v2greater_than_or_equal = var.vulnerability_audit_application_dependency_vulnerability_cvss_v2greater_than_or_equal
	cvss_v3greater_than_or_equal = var.vulnerability_audit_application_dependency_vulnerability_cvss_v3greater_than_or_equal
	gav = var.vulnerability_audit_application_dependency_vulnerability_gav
	vulnerability_id = oci_adm_vulnerability.test_vulnerability.id
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `cvss_v2greater_than_or_equal` - (Optional) A filter that returns only Vulnerability Audits that have a Common Vulnerability Scoring System Version 2 (CVSS V2) greater or equal than the specified value. 
* `cvss_v3greater_than_or_equal` - (Optional) A filter that returns only Vulnerability Audits that have a Common Vulnerability Scoring System Version 3 (CVSS V3) greater or equal than the specified value. 
* `gav` - (Optional) A filter to return only resources that match the entire GAV (Group Artifact Version) identifier given.
* `vulnerability_audit_id` - (Required) Unique Vulnerability Audit identifier path parameter.
* `vulnerability_id` - (Optional) A filter to return only Vulnerability Audits that match the specified id.
