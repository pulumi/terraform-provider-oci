# Data Source: oci_cloud_guard_targets
This data source provides the list of Targets in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Cloud Guard service.

Returns a list of all Targets in a compartment
The ListTargets operation returns only the targets in `compartmentId` passed.
The list does not include any subcompartments of the compartmentId passed.

The parameter `accessLevel` specifies whether to return only those compartments for which the
requestor has INSPECT permissions on at least one resource directly
or indirectly (ACCESSIBLE) (the resource can be in a subcompartment) or to return Not Authorized if
Principal doesn't have access to even one of the child compartments. This is valid only when
`compartmentIdInSubtree` is set to `true`.

The parameter `compartmentIdInSubtree` applies when you perform ListTargets on the
`compartmentId` passed and when it is set to true, the entire hierarchy of compartments can be returned.
To get a full list of all compartments and subcompartments in the tenancy (root compartment),
set the parameter `compartmentIdInSubtree` to true and `accessLevel` to ACCESSIBLE.


## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_cloud_guard_targets" "test_targets" {
	#Required
	compartment_id = var.compartment_id

	#Optional
	access_level = var.target_access_level
	compartment_id_in_subtree = var.target_compartment_id_in_subtree
	display_name = var.target_display_name
	is_non_security_zone_targets_only_query = var.target_is_non_security_zone_targets_only_query
	state = var.target_state
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `access_level` - (Optional) Valid values are `RESTRICTED` and `ACCESSIBLE`. Default is `RESTRICTED`. Setting this to `ACCESSIBLE` returns only those compartments for which the user has INSPECT permissions directly or indirectly (permissions can be on a resource in a subcompartment). When set to `RESTRICTED` permissions are checked and no partial results are displayed. 
* `compartment_id` - (Required) The ID of the compartment in which to list resources.
* `compartment_id_in_subtree` - (Optional) Default is false. When set to true, the hierarchy of compartments is traversed and all compartments and subcompartments in the tenancy are returned depending on the the setting of `accessLevel`. 
* `display_name` - (Optional) A filter to return only resources that match the entire display name given.
* `is_non_security_zone_targets_only_query` - (Optional) Default is false. When set to true, only the targets that would be deleted as part of security zone creation will be returned. 
* `state` - (Optional) The field life cycle state. Only one state can be provided. Default value for state is active. If no value is specified state is active.
