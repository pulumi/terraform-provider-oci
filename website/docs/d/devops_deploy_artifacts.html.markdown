	#Optional
	compartment_id = var.compartment_id
	display_name = var.deploy_artifact_display_name
	id = var.deploy_artifact_id
	project_id = oci_devops_project.test_project.id
	state = var.deploy_artifact_state
}
```

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `deploy_artifact_collection` - The list of deploy_artifact_collection.

### DeployArtifact Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `argument_substitution_mode` - Mode for artifact parameter substitution.
* `compartment_id` - The OCID of a compartment.
* `defined_tags` - Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. See [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm). Example: `{"foo-namespace.bar-key": "value"}`
* `deploy_artifact_source` - Specifies source of an artifact.

* `lifecycle_details` - A detailed message describing the current state. For example, can be used to provide actionable information for a resource in Failed state.
* `project_id` - The OCID of a project.
* `state` - Current state of the deployment artifact.
* `system_tags` - Usage of system tag keys. These predefined keys are scoped to namespaces. See [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm). Example: `{"orcl-cloud.free-tier-retained": "true"}`
* `time_created` - Time the deployment artifact was created. Format defined by [RFC3339](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3339).
