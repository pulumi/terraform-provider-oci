# Data Source: oci_adm_vulnerability_audits
This data source provides the list of Vulnerability Audits in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure ADM service.

Returns a list of Vulnerability Audits based on the specified query parameters.
At least one of id, compartmentId or knowledgeBaseId query parameter must be provided.


## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_adm_vulnerability_audits" "test_vulnerability_audits" {

	#Optional
	compartment_id = var.compartment_id
	display_name = var.vulnerability_audit_display_name
	id = var.vulnerability_audit_id
	is_success = var.vulnerability_audit_is_success
	knowledge_base_id = oci_adm_knowledge_base.test_knowledge_base.id
	state = var.vulnerability_audit_state
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `compartment_id` - (Optional) A filter to return only resources that belong to the specified compartment identifier.
* `display_name` - (Optional) A filter to return only resources that match the entire display name given.
* `id` - (Optional) A filter to return only resources that match the specified identifier.
* `is_success` - (Optional) A filter to return only successful or failed Vulnerability Audits.
* `knowledge_base_id` - (Optional) A filter to return only Vulnerability Audits that were created against the specified knowledge base.
* `state` - (Optional) A filter to return only Vulnerability Audits that match the specified lifecycleState.


## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `vulnerability_audit_collection` - The list of vulnerability_audit_collection.

### VulnerabilityAudit Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `build_type` - The type of the build tool.
* `compartment_id` - The Oracle Cloud identifier ([OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm)) of the compartment associated with the Vulnerability Audit.
* `configuration` - Configuration for a Vulnerability Audit type: object 
	* `exclusions` - Pattern to exclude artifacts from audit.
	* `max_permissible_cvss_v2score` - The minimum CVSS V2 score for a vulnerability to be considered by the audit as failed.
	* `max_permissible_cvss_v3score` - The minimum CVSS V3 score for a vulnerability to be considered by the audit as failed.
* `defined_tags` - Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. Example: `{"foo-namespace.bar-key": "value"}` 
* `display_name` - The name of the Vulnerability Audit.
* `freeform_tags` - Simple key-value pair that is applied without any predefined name, type or scope. Exists for cross-compatibility only. Example: `{"bar-key": "value"}` 
* `id` - The Oracle Cloud identifier ([OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm)) of the Vulnerability Audit.
* `is_success` - Indicates if an audit succeeded according to the configuration. The value is `null` if the audit is in the `CREATING` state.
* `knowledge_base_id` - The Oracle Cloud identifier ([OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm)) of the Knowledge Base.
* `max_observed_cvss_v2score` - Maximum Common Vulnerability Scoring System Version 2 score of vulnerabilities.
* `max_observed_cvss_v3score` - Maximum Common Vulnerability Scoring System Version 3 score of vulnerabilities.
* `state` - The current lifecycle state of the Vulnerability Audit.
* `system_tags` - Usage of system tag keys. These predefined keys are scoped to namespaces. Example: `{"orcl-cloud.free-tier-retained": "true"}` 
* `time_created` - The creation date and time of the Vulnerability Audit (formatted according to [RFC3339](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3339)).
* `time_updated` - The update date and time of the Vulnerability Audit (formatted according to [RFC3339](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3339)).
* `vulnerabilities` - List of vulnerabilities found in the Vulnerability Audit.
	* `cvss_v2score` - Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Version 2.
	* `cvss_v3score` - Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Version 3.
	* `id` - Unique vulnerability identifier.
	* `is_ignored` - Indicates if the vulnerability was ignored according to the audit configuration.
* `vulnerable_artifacts_count` - Count of vulnerable artifacts.
