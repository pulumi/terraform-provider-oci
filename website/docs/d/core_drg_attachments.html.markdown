# Data Source: oci_core_drg_attachments
This data source provides the list of Drg Attachments in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Core service.

Lists the `DrgAttachment` resource for the specified compartment. You can filter the
results by DRG, attached network, attachment type, DRG route table or
VCN route table.

The LIST API lists DRG attachments by attachment type. It will default to list VCN attachments,
but you may request to list ALL attachments of ALL types.


## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_core_drg_attachments" "test_drg_attachments" {
	#Required
	compartment_id = var.compartment_id

	#Optional
	attachment_type = var.drg_attachment_attachment_type
	display_name = var.drg_attachment_display_name
	drg_id = oci_core_drg.test_drg.id
	drg_route_table_id = oci_core_drg_route_table.test_drg_route_table.id
	network_id = oci_core_network.test_network.id
	state = var.drg_attachment_state
	vcn_id = oci_core_vcn.test_vcn.id
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `attachment_type` - (Optional) The type for the network resource attached to the DRG.
* `compartment_id` - (Required) The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the compartment.
* `display_name` - (Optional) A filter to return only resources that match the given display name exactly. 
* `drg_id` - (Optional) The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the DRG.
* `drg_route_table_id` - (Optional) The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the DRG route table assigned to the DRG attachment.
* `network_id` - (Optional) The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the resource (virtual circuit, VCN, IPSec tunnel, or remote peering connection) attached to the DRG.
* `state` - (Optional) A filter to return only resources that match the specified lifecycle state. The value is case insensitive. 
* `vcn_id` - (Optional) The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the VCN.


## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `drg_attachments` - The list of drg_attachments.

### DrgAttachment Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `compartment_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the compartment containing the DRG attachment.
* `defined_tags` - Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{"Operations.CostCenter": "42"}` 
* `display_name` - A user-friendly name. Does not have to be unique, and it's changeable. Avoid entering confidential information. 
* `drg_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the DRG.
* `drg_route_table_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the DRG route table that is assigned to this attachment.

	The DRG route table manages traffic inside the DRG. 
* `export_drg_route_distribution_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the export route distribution used to specify how routes in the assigned DRG route table are advertised to the attachment. If this value is null, no routes are advertised through this attachment. 
* `freeform_tags` - Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{"Department": "Finance"}` 
* `id` - The DRG attachment's Oracle ID ([OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm)).
* `is_cross_tenancy` - Indicates whether the DRG attachment and attached network live in a different tenancy than the DRG.  Example: `false` 
* `network_details` - 
	* `id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the network attached to the DRG. 
	* `ipsec_connection_id` - The IPSec connection that contains the attached IPSec tunnel.
	* `route_table_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the route table the DRG attachment is using.

		* [Transit Routing: Access to Multiple VCNs in Same Region](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/transitrouting.htm)
		* [Transit Routing: Private Access to Oracle Services](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/transitroutingoracleservices.htm) 
	* `type` - The type can be one of these values: `IPSEC_TUNNEL`, `REMOTE_PEERING_CONNECTION`, `VCN`, `VIRTUAL_CIRCUIT`
	* `vcn_route_type` - Indicates whether the VCN CIDRs or the individual subnet CIDRs are imported from the attachment. Routes from the VCN ingress route table are always imported. 
* `route_table_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the route table the DRG attachment is using.
