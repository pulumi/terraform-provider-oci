# Data Source: oci_core_volume
This data source provides details about a specific Volume resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Core service.

Gets information for the specified volume.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_core_volume" "test_volume" {
	#Required
	volume_id = oci_core_volume.test_volume.id
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `volume_id` - (Required) The OCID of the volume.


## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `auto_tuned_vpus_per_gb` - The number of Volume Performance Units per GB that this volume is effectively tuned to when it's idle. 
* `availability_domain` - The availability domain of the volume.  Example: `Uocm:PHX-AD-1` 
* `block_volume_replicas` - The list of block volume replicas of this volume.
	* `availability_domain` - The availability domain of the block volume replica.  Example: `Uocm:PHX-AD-1` 
	* `block_volume_replica_id` - The block volume replica's Oracle ID (OCID).
	* `display_name` - A user-friendly name. Does not have to be unique, and it's changeable. Avoid entering confidential information. 
* `compartment_id` - The OCID of the compartment that contains the volume.
* `defined_tags` - Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{"Operations.CostCenter": "42"}` 
* `display_name` - A user-friendly name. Does not have to be unique, and it's changeable. Avoid entering confidential information. 
* `freeform_tags` - Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{"Department": "Finance"}` 
* `id` - The OCID of the volume.
* `is_auto_tune_enabled` - Specifies whether the auto-tune performance is enabled for this boot volume.
* `is_hydrated` - Specifies whether the cloned volume's data has finished copying from the source volume or backup. 
* `kms_key_id` - The OCID of the Key Management key which is the master encryption key for the volume. 
* `size_in_gbs` - The size of the volume in GBs.
* `size_in_mbs` - The size of the volume in MBs. This field is deprecated. Use sizeInGBs instead.
* `source_details` - 
	* `id` - The OCID of the block volume replica.
	* `type` - The type can be one of these values: `blockVolumeReplica`, `volume`, `volumeBackup`
* `state` - The current state of a volume.
* `system_tags` - System tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. Example: `{"foo-namespace.bar-key": "value"}` 
* `time_created` - The date and time the volume was created. Format defined by [RFC3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339).
* `volume_group_id` - The OCID of the source volume group.
* `vpus_per_gb` - The number of volume performance units (VPUs) that will be applied to this volume per GB, representing the Block Volume service's elastic performance options. See [Block Volume Performance Levels](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Block/Concepts/blockvolumeperformance.htm#perf_levels) for more information.

	Allowed values:
	* `0`: Represents Lower Cost option.
	* `10`: Represents Balanced option.
	* `20`: Represents Higher Performance option.
	* `30`-`120`: Represents the Ultra High Performance option.
