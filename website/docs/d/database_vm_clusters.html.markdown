# Data Source: oci_database_vm_clusters
This data source provides the list of Vm Clusters in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Database service.

Lists the VM clusters in the specified compartment. Applies to Exadata Cloud@Customer instances only.
To list the cloud VM clusters in an Exadata Cloud Service instance, use the [ListCloudVmClusters ](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/database/latest/CloudVmCluster/ListCloudVmClusters) operation.


## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_database_vm_clusters" "test_vm_clusters" {
	#Required
	compartment_id = var.compartment_id

	#Optional
	display_name = var.vm_cluster_display_name
	exadata_infrastructure_id = oci_database_exadata_infrastructure.test_exadata_infrastructure.id
	state = var.vm_cluster_state
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `compartment_id` - (Required) The compartment [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm).
* `display_name` - (Optional) A filter to return only resources that match the entire display name given. The match is not case sensitive.
* `exadata_infrastructure_id` - (Optional) If provided, filters the results for the given Exadata Infrastructure.
* `state` - (Optional) A filter to return only resources that match the given lifecycle state exactly.


## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `vm_clusters` - The list of vm_clusters.

### VmCluster Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `compartment_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the compartment.
* `cpus_enabled` - The number of enabled CPU cores.
* `data_collection_options` - Indicates user preferences for the various diagnostic collection options for the VM cluster. 
	* `is_diagnostics_events_enabled` - Indicates whether diagnostic collection is enabled for the VM cluster. Enabling diagnostic collection allows you to receive Events service notifications for guest VM issues. Diagnostic collection also allows Oracle to provide enhanced service and proactive support for your Exadata system. You can enable diagnostic collection during VM cluster provisioning. You can also disable or enable it at any time using the `UpdateVmCluster` API. 
* `data_storage_size_in_tbs` - Size, in terabytes, of the DATA disk group.
* `db_node_storage_size_in_gbs` - The local node storage allocated in GBs.
* `db_servers` - The list of Db server.
* `defined_tags` - Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm). 
* `display_name` - The user-friendly name for the Exadata Cloud@Customer VM cluster. The name does not need to be unique.
* `exadata_infrastructure_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the Exadata infrastructure.
* `freeform_tags` - Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{"Department": "Finance"}` 
* `gi_version` - The Oracle Grid Infrastructure software version for the VM cluster.
* `id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the VM cluster.
* `is_local_backup_enabled` - If true, database backup on local Exadata storage is configured for the VM cluster. If false, database backup on local Exadata storage is not available in the VM cluster. 
* `is_sparse_diskgroup_enabled` - If true, sparse disk group is configured for the VM cluster. If false, sparse disk group is not created. 
* `last_patch_history_entry_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the last patch history. This value is updated as soon as a patch operation starts.
* `license_model` - The Oracle license model that applies to the VM cluster. The default is LICENSE_INCLUDED. 
* `lifecycle_details` - Additional information about the current lifecycle state.
* `memory_size_in_gbs` - The memory allocated in GBs.
* `shape` - The shape of the Exadata infrastructure. The shape determines the amount of CPU, storage, and memory resources allocated to the instance. 
* `ssh_public_keys` - The public key portion of one or more key pairs used for SSH access to the VM cluster.
* `state` - The current state of the VM cluster.
* `system_version` - Operating system version of the image.
* `time_created` - The date and time that the VM cluster was created.
* `time_zone` - The time zone of the Exadata infrastructure. For details, see [Exadata Infrastructure Time Zones](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Database/References/timezones.htm).
* `vm_cluster_network_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the VM cluster network.
