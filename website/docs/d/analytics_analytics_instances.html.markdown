# Data Source: oci_analytics_analytics_instances
This data source provides the list of Analytics Instances in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Analytics service.

List Analytics instances.


## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_analytics_analytics_instances" "test_analytics_instances" {
	#Required
	compartment_id = var.compartment_id

	#Optional
	capacity_type = var.analytics_instance_capacity_type
	feature_set = var.analytics_instance_feature_set
	name = var.analytics_instance_name
	state = var.analytics_instance_state
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `capacity_type` - (Optional) A filter to only return resources matching the capacity type enum. Values are case-insensitive. 
* `compartment_id` - (Required) The OCID of the compartment. 
* `feature_set` - (Optional) A filter to only return resources matching the feature set. Values are case-insensitive. 
* `name` - (Optional) A filter to return only resources that match the given name exactly. 
* `state` - (Optional) A filter to only return resources matching the lifecycle state. The state value is case-insensitive. 


## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `analytics_instances` - The list of analytics_instances.

### AnalyticsInstance Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `capacity` - Service instance capacity metadata (e.g.: OLPU count, number of users, ...etc...). 
	* `capacity_type` - The capacity model to use. 
	* `capacity_value` - The capacity value selected (OLPU count, number of users, ...etc...). This parameter affects the number of CPUs, amount of memory or other resources allocated to the instance. 
* `compartment_id` - The OCID of the compartment. 
* `defined_tags` - Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{"Operations.CostCenter": "42"}` 
* `description` - Optional description. 
* `email_notification` - Email address receiving notifications. 
* `feature_set` - Analytics feature set.

* `id` - The resource OCID. 
* `kms_key_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Vault Key encrypting the customer data stored in this Analytics instance. A null value indicates Oracle managed default encryption.
