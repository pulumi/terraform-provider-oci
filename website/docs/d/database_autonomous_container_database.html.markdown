data "oci_database_autonomous_container_database" "test_autonomous_container_database" {
	#Required
	autonomous_container_database_id = oci_database_autonomous_container_database.test_autonomous_container_database.id
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `display_name` - The user-provided name for the Autonomous Container Database.
* `freeform_tags` - Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{"Department": "Finance"}` 
* `id` - The OCID of the Autonomous Container Database.
* `infrastructure_type` - The infrastructure type this resource belongs to.
* `key_history_entry` - Key History Entry.
	* `id` - The id of the Autonomous Database [Vault](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/KeyManagement/Concepts/keyoverview.htm#concepts) service key management history entry.
	* `kms_key_version_id` - The OCID of the key container version that is used in database transparent data encryption (TDE) operations KMS Key can have multiple key versions. If none is specified, the current key version (latest) of the Key Id is used for the operation. 
	* `time_activated` - The date and time the kms key activated.
	* `vault_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure [vault](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/KeyManagement/Concepts/keyoverview.htm#concepts).
* `key_store_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the key store.
* `key_store_wallet_name` - The wallet name for Oracle Key Vault.
* `kms_key_id` - The OCID of the key container that is used as the master encryption key in database transparent data encryption (TDE) operations.
* `kms_key_version_id` - The OCID of the key container version that is used in database transparent data encryption (TDE) operations KMS Key can have multiple key versions. If none is specified, the current key version (latest) of the Key Id is used for the operation. 
* `last_maintenance_run_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the last maintenance run.
* `lifecycle_details` - Additional information about the current lifecycle state.
* `maintenance_window` - The scheduling details for the quarterly maintenance window. Patching and system updates take place during the maintenance window. 
	* `custom_action_timeout_in_mins` - Determines the amount of time the system will wait before the start of each database server patching operation. Custom action timeout is in minutes and valid value is between 15 to 120 (inclusive). 
	* `days_of_week` - Days during the week when maintenance should be performed.
		* `name` - Name of the day of the week.
	* `hours_of_day` - The window of hours during the day when maintenance should be performed. The window is a 4 hour slot. Valid values are
		* 0 - represents time slot 0:00 - 3:59 UTC - 4 - represents time slot 4:00 - 7:59 UTC - 8 - represents time slot 8:00 - 11:59 UTC - 12 - represents time slot 12:00 - 15:59 UTC - 16 - represents time slot 16:00 - 19:59 UTC - 20 - represents time slot 20:00 - 23:59 UTC

	* `preference` - The maintenance window scheduling preference.
	* `weeks_of_month` - Weeks during the month when maintenance should be performed. Weeks start on the 1st, 8th, 15th, and 22nd days of the month, and have a duration of 7 days. Weeks start and end based on calendar dates, not days of the week. For example, to allow maintenance during the 2nd week of the month (from the 8th day to the 14th day of the month), use the value 2. Maintenance cannot be scheduled for the fifth week of months that contain more than 28 days. Note that this parameter works in conjunction with the  daysOfWeek and hoursOfDay parameters to allow you to specify specific days of the week and hours that maintenance will be performed. 
* `memory_per_oracle_compute_unit_in_gbs` - The amount of memory (in GBs) enabled per each OCPU core in Autonomous VM Cluster.

* `patch_model` - Database patch model preference.
* `provisionable_cpus` - An array of CPU values that can be used to successfully provision a single Autonomous Database.
* `reclaimable_cpus` - CPU cores that continue to be included in the count of OCPUs available to the Autonomous Container Database even after one of its Autonomous Database is terminated or scaled down. You can release them to the available OCPUs at its parent AVMC level by restarting the Autonomous Container Database.
* `role` - The role of the Autonomous Data Guard-enabled Autonomous Container Database.
* `service_level_agreement_type` - The service level agreement type of the container database. The default is STANDARD.
* `standby_maintenance_buffer_in_days` - The scheduling detail for the quarterly maintenance window of the standby Autonomous Container Database. This value represents the number of days before scheduled maintenance of the primary database. 
* `state` - The current state of the Autonomous Container Database.
* `time_created` - The date and time the Autonomous Container Database was created.
* `total_cpus` - The number of CPU cores allocated to the Autonomous VM cluster.
* `vault_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure [vault](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/KeyManagement/Concepts/keyoverview.htm#concepts).
