# Data Source: oci_service_mesh_mesh
This data source provides details about a specific Mesh resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Service Mesh service.

Gets a Mesh by identifier.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_service_mesh_mesh" "test_mesh" {
	#Required
	mesh_id = oci_service_mesh_mesh.test_mesh.id
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `mesh_id` - (Required) Unique Mesh identifier.


## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `certificate_authorities` - A list of certificate authority resources to use for creating leaf certificates for mTLS authentication. Currently we only support one certificate authority, but this may expand in future releases. 
	* `id` - The OCID of the certificate authority resource.
* `compartment_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the compartment. 
* `defined_tags` - Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. Example: `{"foo-namespace.bar-key": "value"}` 
* `description` - Description of the resource. It can be changed after creation. Avoid entering confidential information.  Example: `This is my new resource` 
* `display_name` - A user-friendly name. The name does not have to be unique and can be changed after creation. Avoid entering confidential information.  Example: `My new resource` 
* `freeform_tags` - Simple key-value pair that is applied without any predefined name, type or scope. Exists for cross-compatibility only. Example: `{"bar-key": "value"}` 
* `id` - Unique identifier that is immutable on creation.
* `lifecycle_details` - A message describing the current state in more detail. For example, can be used to provide actionable information for a resource in a Failed state.
* `mtls` - Sets a minimum level of mTLS authentication for all virtual services within the mesh.
	* `minimum` - DISABLED: No minimum virtual services within this mesh can use any mTLS authentication mode. PERMISSIVE: Virtual services within this mesh can use either PERMISSIVE or STRICT modes. STRICT: All virtual services within this mesh must use STRICT mode. 
* `state` - The current state of the Resource.
* `system_tags` - Usage of system tag keys. These predefined keys are scoped to namespaces. Example: `{"orcl-cloud.free-tier-retained": "true"}` 
* `time_created` - The time when this resource was created in an RFC3339 formatted datetime string.
* `time_updated` - The time when this resource was updated in an RFC3339 formatted datetime string.
