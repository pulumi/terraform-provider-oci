Gets the specified service connector's configuration information.


## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_sch_service_connector" "test_service_connector" {
	#Required
	service_connector_id = oci_sch_service_connector.test_service_connector.id
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

		* `namespace_details` - Discriminator for namespaces in the compartment-specific list. 
			* `kind` - The type discriminator. 
			* `namespaces` - The namespaces for the compartment-specific list. 
				* `metrics` - The metrics to query for the specified metric namespace. 
					* `kind` - The type descriminator. 
				* `namespace` - The source service or application to use when querying for metric data points. Must begin with `oci_`.  Example: `oci_computeagent` 
	* `stream_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the stream. 
* `state` - The current state of the service connector. 
* `system_tags` - The system tags associated with this resource, if any. The system tags are set by Oracle Cloud Infrastructure services. Each key is predefined and scoped to namespaces. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm). Example: `{orcl-cloud: {free-tier-retain: true}}` 
* `target` - An object that represents the target of the flow defined by the service connector. An example target is a stream (Streaming service). For more information about flows defined by service connectors, see [Service Connector Hub Overview](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/service-connector-hub/overview.htm). For configuration instructions, see [To create a service connector](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/service-connector-hub/managingconnectors.htm#create). 
	* `batch_rollover_size_in_mbs` - The batch rollover size in megabytes. 
	* `batch_rollover_time_in_ms` - The batch rollover time in milliseconds. 
	* `bucket` - The name of the bucket. Avoid entering confidential information. 
	* `compartment_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the compartment containing the metric. 
	* `dimensions` - List of dimension names and values. 
		* `dimension_value` - Instructions for extracting the value corresponding to the specified dimension key: Either extract the value as-is (static) or derive the value from a path (evaluated). 
			* `kind` - The type of dimension value: static or evaluated. 
			* `path` - The location to use for deriving the dimension value (evaluated). The path must start with `logContent` in an acceptable notation style with supported [JMESPath selectors](https://jmespath.org/specification.html): expression with dot and index operator (`.` and `[]`).

The returned value depends on the results of evaluation. If the evaluated value is valid, then the evaluated value is returned without double quotes. (Any front or trailing double quotes are trimmed before returning the value. For example, the evaluated value `"compartmentId"` is returned as `compartmentId`.) If the evaluated value is invalid, then the returned value is `SCH_EVAL_INVALID_VALUE`. If the evaluated value is empty, then the returned value is `SCH_EVAL_VALUE_EMPTY`. 
			* `value` - The data extracted from the specified dimension value (passed as-is). Unicode characters only. For information on valid dimension keys and values, see [MetricDataDetails Reference](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/monitoring/latest/datatypes/MetricDataDetails). 
		* `name` - Dimension key. A valid dimension key includes only printable ASCII, excluding periods (.) and spaces. Custom dimension keys are acceptable. Avoid entering confidential information. Due to use by Service Connector Hub, the following dimension names are reserved: `connectorId`, `connectorName`, `connectorSourceType`. For information on valid dimension keys and values, see [MetricDataDetails Reference](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/monitoring/latest/datatypes/MetricDataDetails). Example: `type`

	* `metric_namespace` - The namespace of the metric.  Example: `oci_computeagent` 
	* `namespace` - The namespace.
