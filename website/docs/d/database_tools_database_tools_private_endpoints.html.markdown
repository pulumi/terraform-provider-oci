# Data Source: oci_database_tools_database_tools_private_endpoints
This data source provides the list of Database Tools Private Endpoints in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Database Tools service.

Returns a list of Database Tools private endpoints.


## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_database_tools_database_tools_private_endpoints" "test_database_tools_private_endpoints" {
	#Required
	compartment_id = var.compartment_id

	#Optional
	display_name = var.database_tools_private_endpoint_display_name
	endpoint_service_id = oci_core_service.test_service.id
	state = var.database_tools_private_endpoint_state
	subnet_id = oci_core_subnet.test_subnet.id
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `compartment_id` - (Required) The ID of the compartment in which to list resources.
* `display_name` - (Optional) A filter to return only resources that match the entire specified display name.
* `endpoint_service_id` - (Optional) A filter to return only resources their `endpointServiceId` matches the specified `endpointServiceId`.
* `state` - (Optional) A filter to return only resources their `lifecycleState` matches the specified `lifecycleState`.
* `subnet_id` - (Optional) A filter to return only resources their `subnetId` matches the specified `subnetId`.


## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `database_tools_private_endpoint_collection` - The list of database_tools_private_endpoint_collection.

### DatabaseToolsPrivateEndpoint Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `additional_fqdns` - A list of additional FQDNs that can be also be used for the private endpoint.
* `compartment_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the compartment containing the Database Tools private endpoint.
* `defined_tags` - Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. Example: `{"foo-namespace.bar-key": "value"}` 
* `description` - A description of the Database Tools private endpoint.
* `display_name` - A user-friendly name. Does not have to be unique, and it's changeable. Avoid entering confidential information.
* `endpoint_fqdn` - Then FQDN to use for the private endpoint.
* `endpoint_service_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the Database Tools Endpoint Service.
* `freeform_tags` - Simple key-value pair that is applied without any predefined name, type or scope. Exists for cross-compatibility only. Example: `{"bar-key": "value"}` 
* `id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the Database Tools private endpoint.
