# Data Source: oci_adm_vulnerability_audit
This data source provides details about a specific Vulnerability Audit resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure ADM service.

Returns the details of the specified Vulnerability Audit.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_adm_vulnerability_audit" "test_vulnerability_audit" {
	#Required
	vulnerability_audit_id = oci_adm_vulnerability_audit.test_vulnerability_audit.id
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `vulnerability_audit_id` - (Required) Unique Vulnerability Audit identifier path parameter.


## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `build_type` - The type of the build tool.
* `compartment_id` - The Oracle Cloud identifier ([OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm)) of the compartment associated with the Vulnerability Audit.
* `configuration` - Configuration for a Vulnerability Audit type: object 
	* `exclusions` - Pattern to exclude artifacts from audit.
	* `max_permissible_cvss_v2score` - The minimum CVSS V2 score for a vulnerability to be considered by the audit as failed.
	* `max_permissible_cvss_v3score` - The minimum CVSS V3 score for a vulnerability to be considered by the audit as failed.
* `defined_tags` - Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. Example: `{"foo-namespace.bar-key": "value"}` 
* `display_name` - The name of the Vulnerability Audit.
* `freeform_tags` - Simple key-value pair that is applied without any predefined name, type or scope. Exists for cross-compatibility only. Example: `{"bar-key": "value"}` 
* `id` - The Oracle Cloud identifier ([OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm)) of the Vulnerability Audit.
* `is_success` - Indicates if an audit succeeded according to the configuration. The value is `null` if the audit is in the `CREATING` state.
* `knowledge_base_id` - The Oracle Cloud identifier ([OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm)) of the Knowledge Base.
* `max_observed_cvss_v2score` - Maximum Common Vulnerability Scoring System Version 2 score of vulnerabilities.
* `max_observed_cvss_v3score` - Maximum Common Vulnerability Scoring System Version 3 score of vulnerabilities.
* `state` - The current lifecycle state of the Vulnerability Audit.
* `system_tags` - Usage of system tag keys. These predefined keys are scoped to namespaces. Example: `{"orcl-cloud.free-tier-retained": "true"}` 
* `time_created` - The creation date and time of the Vulnerability Audit (formatted according to [RFC3339](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3339)).

* `vulnerabilities` - List of vulnerabilities found in the Vulnerability Audit.
	* `cvss_v2score` - Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Version 2.
	* `cvss_v3score` - Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Version 3.
	* `id` - Unique vulnerability identifier.
	* `is_ignored` - Indicates if the vulnerability was ignored according to the audit configuration.
* `vulnerable_artifacts_count` - Count of vulnerable artifacts.
