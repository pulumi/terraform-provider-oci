# Data Source: oci_vulnerability_scanning_host_scan_recipes
This data source provides the list of Host Scan Recipes in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Vulnerability Scanning service.

Retrieves a list of HostScanRecipeSummary objects in a compartment. A recipe determines the types of security issues that you want scanned, and how often to scan.


## Example Usage

```hcl
data "oci_vulnerability_scanning_host_scan_recipes" "test_host_scan_recipes" {
	#Required
	compartment_id = var.compartment_id

	#Optional
	display_name = var.host_scan_recipe_display_name
	state = var.host_scan_recipe_state
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `compartment_id` - (Required) The ID of the compartment in which to list resources.
* `display_name` - (Optional) A filter to return only resources that match the entire display name given.
* `state` - (Optional) A filter to return only resources whose lifecycleState matches the given lifecycleState.


## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `host_scan_recipe_summary_collection` - The list of host_scan_recipe_summary_collection.

### HostScanRecipe Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `agent_settings` - Agent scan settings for a host scan
	* `agent_configuration` - Agent configuration for host scan agent settings. This model is polymorphic, presenting different configuration options based on selected agent vendor.
		* `cis_benchmark_settings` - CIS (Center for Internet Security) Benchmark scan settings for a host scan
			* `scan_level` - The level of strictness to apply for CIS Benchmarks. Use 'NONE' to disable CIS Benchmark checks entirely.
		* `endpoint_protection_settings` - Endpoint Protection scan settings for a host scan
			* `scan_level` - The scan level. Use 'NONE' to disable Endpoint Protection checks entirely.
		* `vendor` - Vendor to use for the host scan agent.
	* `scan_level` - The scan level
* `application_settings` - Agent scan settings for an application scan (as a part of a host scan)
	* `application_scan_recurrence` - Scan recurrences in RFC-5545 section 3.3.10 format. Only supported input are weekly, biweekly, monthly listed below FREQ=WEEKLY;WKST=<weekday>;INTERVAL=1 - This weekly scan on the specified weekday (e.g. SU for Sunday) FREQ=WEEKLY;WKST=<weekday>;INTERVAL=2 - This bi-weekly scan on the specified weekday (e.g. SU for Sunday) FREQ=MONTHLY;WKST=<weekday>;INTERVAL=1 - This monthly scan on the specified weekday (e.g. SU for Sunday, starting from the next such weekday based on the time of setting creation)
	* `folders_to_scan` - List of folders selected for scanning
		* `folder` - Folder to be scanned in the corresponding operating system
		* `operatingsystem` - Operating system type
	* `is_enabled` - Enable or disable application scan
* `compartment_id` - Compartment ID of the scan recipe
* `defined_tags` - Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. Example: `{"foo-namespace.bar-key": "value"}` 
* `display_name` - Recipe identifier, which can be renamed
* `freeform_tags` - Simple key-value pair that is applied without any predefined name, type or scope. Exists for cross-compatibility only. Example: `{"bar-key": "value"}` 
* `id` - Unique identifier of the config that is immutable on creation
* `port_settings` - Port scan settings for a host scan
	* `scan_level` - The scan level
* `schedule` - A scanning schedule
	* `day_of_week` - Day of week the scheduled scan occurs (not applicable for DAILY type)
	* `type` - How often the scan occurs
* `state` - The current state of the config.
* `system_tags` - Usage of system tag keys. These predefined keys are scoped to namespaces. Example: `{"orcl-cloud.free-tier-retained": "true"}` 
* `time_created` - Date and time the recipe was created, format as described in [RFC 3339](https://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339)
* `time_updated` - Date and time the recipe was last updated, format as described in [RFC 3339](https://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339)
