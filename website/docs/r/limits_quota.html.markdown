resource "oci_limits_quota" "test_quota" {
	#Required
	compartment_id = var.tenancy_ocid
	description = var.quota_description
	name = var.quota_name
	statements = var.quota_statements

	#Optional
	defined_tags = {"Operations.CostCenter"= "42"}
	freeform_tags = {"Department"= "Finance"}
	locks {
		#Required
		type = var.quota_locks_type

		#Optional
		message = var.quota_locks_message
		related_resource_id = oci_limits_related_resource.test_related_resource.id
	}	
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `compartment_id` - (Required) The OCID of the compartment containing the resource this quota applies to.
* `defined_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm). Example: `{"Operations.CostCenter": "42"}` 
* `description` - (Required) (Updatable) The description you assign to the quota.
* `freeform_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm). Example: `{"Department": "Finance"}` 
* `locks` - (Optional) Locks associated with this resource.
	* `message` - (Optional) A message added by the lock creator. The message typically gives an indication of why the resource is locked. 
	* `related_resource_id` - (Optional) The resource ID that is locking this resource. Indicates that deleting this resource removes the lock. 
	* `type` - (Required) Lock type.
* `name` - (Required) The name you assign to the quota during creation. The name must be unique across all quotas in the tenancy and cannot be changed. 
* `statements` - (Required) (Updatable) An array of quota statements written in the declarative quota statement language. 

** IMPORTANT **
Any change to a property that does not support update will force the destruction and recreation of the resource with the new property values
