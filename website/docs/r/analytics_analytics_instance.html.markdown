# oci_analytics_analytics_instance
This resource provides the Analytics Instance resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Analytics service.

Create a new AnalyticsInstance in the specified compartment. The operation is long-running
and creates a new WorkRequest.


## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "oci_analytics_analytics_instance" "test_analytics_instance" {
	#Required
	capacity {
		#Required
		capacity_type = var.analytics_instance_capacity_capacity_type
		capacity_value = var.analytics_instance_capacity_capacity_value
	}
	compartment_id = var.compartment_id
	feature_set = var.analytics_instance_feature_set
	idcs_access_token = var.analytics_instance_idcs_access_token
	license_type = var.analytics_instance_license_type
	name = var.analytics_instance_name

	#Optional
	defined_tags = {"Operations.CostCenter"= "42"}
	description = var.analytics_instance_description
	email_notification = var.analytics_instance_email_notification
	freeform_tags = {"Department"= "Finance"}
	kms_key_id = oci_kms_key.test_key.id
	network_endpoint_details {
		#Required
		network_endpoint_type = var.analytics_instance_network_endpoint_details_network_endpoint_type

		#Optional
		subnet_id = oci_core_subnet.test_subnet.id
		vcn_id = oci_core_vcn.test_vcn.id
		whitelisted_ips = var.analytics_instance_network_endpoint_details_whitelisted_ips
		whitelisted_vcns {

			#Optional
			id = var.analytics_instance_network_endpoint_details_whitelisted_vcns_id
			whitelisted_ips = var.analytics_instance_network_endpoint_details_whitelisted_vcns_whitelisted_ips
		}
	}
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `capacity` - (Required) Service instance capacity metadata (e.g.: OLPU count, number of users, ...etc...). 
	* `capacity_type` - (Required) The capacity model to use. 
	* `capacity_value` - (Required) (Updatable) The capacity value selected (OLPU count, number of users, ...etc...). This parameter affects the number of CPUs, amount of memory or other resources allocated to the instance. 
* `compartment_id` - (Required) (Updatable) The OCID of the compartment. 
* `defined_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{"Operations.CostCenter": "42"}` 
* `description` - (Optional) (Updatable) Optional description. 
* `email_notification` - (Optional) (Updatable) Email address receiving notifications. 
* `feature_set` - (Required) Analytics feature set. 
* `freeform_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{"Department": "Finance"}` 
* `idcs_access_token` - (Required) IDCS access token identifying a stripe and service administrator user. 
* `kms_key_id` - (Optional) The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Vault Key encrypting the customer data stored in this Analytics instance. Omitting this value or specifying an empty string (i.e. "") indicates to use Oracle managed default encryption. 
* `license_type` - (Required) (Updatable) The license used for the service. 
* `name` - (Required) The name of the Analytics instance. This name must be unique in the tenancy and cannot be changed. 
* `network_endpoint_details` - (Optional) Base representation of a network endpoint. 
	* `network_endpoint_type` - (Required) The type of network endpoint. 
	* `subnet_id` - (Required when network_endpoint_type=PRIVATE) The subnet OCID for the private endpoint. 
	* `vcn_id` - (Required when network_endpoint_type=PRIVATE) The VCN OCID for the private endpoint. 
	* `whitelisted_ips` - (Applicable when network_endpoint_type=PUBLIC) Source IP addresses or IP address ranges igress rules. 
	* `whitelisted_vcns` - (Applicable when network_endpoint_type=PUBLIC) Virtual Cloud Networks allowed to access this network endpoint. 
		* `id` - (Required when network_endpoint_type=PUBLIC) The Virtual Cloud Network OCID. 
		* `whitelisted_ips` - (Applicable when network_endpoint_type=PUBLIC) Source IP addresses or IP address ranges igress rules. 
* `state` - (Optional) (Updatable) The target state for the Analytics Instance. Could be set to `ACTIVE` or `INACTIVE`. 


** IMPORTANT **
Any change to a property that does not support update will force the destruction and recreation of the resource with the new property values
