# oci_functions_function
This resource provides the Function resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Functions service.

Creates a new function.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "oci_functions_function" "test_function" {
	#Required
	application_id = oci_functions_application.test_application.id
	display_name = var.function_display_name
	image = var.function_image
	memory_in_mbs = var.function_memory_in_mbs

	#Optional
	config = var.function_config
	defined_tags = {"Operations.CostCenter"= "42"}
	freeform_tags = {"Department"= "Finance"}
	image_digest = var.function_image_digest
	provisioned_concurrency_config {
		#Required
		strategy = var.function_provisioned_concurrency_config_strategy

		#Optional
		count = var.function_provisioned_concurrency_config_count
	}
	timeout_in_seconds = var.function_timeout_in_seconds
	trace_config {

		#Optional
		is_enabled = var.function_trace_config_is_enabled
	}
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `application_id` - (Required) The OCID of the application this function belongs to.
* `config` - (Optional) (Updatable) Function configuration. These values are passed on to the function as environment variables, this overrides application configuration values. Keys must be ASCII strings consisting solely of letters, digits, and the '_' (underscore) character, and must not begin with a digit. Values should be limited to printable unicode characters.  Example: `{"MY_FUNCTION_CONFIG": "ConfVal"}`

	The maximum size for all configuration keys and values is limited to 4KB. This is measured as the sum of octets necessary to represent each key and value in UTF-8. 
* `defined_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{"Operations.CostCenter": "42"}` 
* `display_name` - (Required) The display name of the function. The display name must be unique within the application containing the function. Avoid entering confidential information. 
* `freeform_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{"Department": "Finance"}` 
* `image` - (Required) (Updatable) The qualified name of the Docker image to use in the function, including the image tag. The image should be in the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Registry that is in the same region as the function itself. This field must be updated if image_digest is updated. Example: `phx.ocir.io/ten/functions/function:0.0.1`
* `image_digest` - (Optional) (Updatable) The image digest for the version of the image that will be pulled when invoking this function. If no value is specified, the digest currently associated with the image in the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Registry will be used. This field must be updated if image is updated. Example: `sha256:ca0eeb6fb05351dfc8759c20733c91def84cb8007aa89a5bf606bc8b315b9fc7`
* `memory_in_mbs` - (Required) (Updatable) Maximum usable memory for the function (MiB).
* `provisioned_concurrency_config` - (Optional) (Updatable) Define the strategy for provisioned concurrency for the function. 
	* `count` - (Required when strategy=CONSTANT) (Updatable) 
	* `strategy` - (Required) (Updatable) The strategy for provisioned concurrency to be used. 
* `timeout_in_seconds` - (Optional) (Updatable) Timeout for executions of the function. Value in seconds.
* `trace_config` - (Optional) (Updatable) Define the tracing configuration for a function. 
	* `is_enabled` - (Optional) (Updatable) Define if tracing is enabled for the resource. 


** IMPORTANT **
Any change to a property that does not support update will force the destruction and recreation of the resource with the new property values

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `application_id` - The OCID of the application the function belongs to.
* `compartment_id` - The OCID of the compartment that contains the function. 
* `config` - Function configuration. Overrides application configuration. Keys must be ASCII strings consisting solely of letters, digits, and the '_' (underscore) character, and must not begin with a digit. Values should be limited to printable unicode characters.  Example: `{"MY_FUNCTION_CONFIG": "ConfVal"}`

	The maximum size for all configuration keys and values is limited to 4KB. This is measured as the sum of octets necessary to represent each key and value in UTF-8. 
* `defined_tags` - Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{"Operations.CostCenter": "42"}` 
* `display_name` - The display name of the function. The display name is unique within the application containing the function. 
* `freeform_tags` - Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{"Department": "Finance"}` 
* `id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the function. 
* `image` - The qualified name of the Docker image to use in the function, including the image tag. The image should be in the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Registry that is in the same region as the function itself. This field must be updated if image_digest is updated.

## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/oci/latest/docs/guides/changing_timeouts) for certain operations:
	* `create` - (Defaults to 20 minutes), when creating the Function
	* `update` - (Defaults to 20 minutes), when updating the Function
	* `delete` - (Defaults to 20 minutes), when destroying the Function


## Import

Functions can be imported using the `id`, e.g.

```
$ terraform import oci_functions_function.test_function "id"
```
