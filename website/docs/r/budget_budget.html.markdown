# oci_budget_budget
This resource provides the Budget resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Budget service.

Creates a new budget.


## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "oci_budget_budget" "test_budget" {
	#Required
	amount = var.budget_amount
	compartment_id = var.tenancy_ocid
	reset_period = var.budget_reset_period

	#Optional
	budget_processing_period_start_offset = var.budget_budget_processing_period_start_offset
	defined_tags = {"Operations.CostCenter"= "42"}
	description = var.budget_description
	display_name = var.budget_display_name
	freeform_tags = {"Department"= "Finance"}
	processing_period_type = var.budget_processing_period_type
	target_compartment_id = oci_identity_compartment.test_compartment.id
	target_type = var.budget_target_type
	targets = var.budget_targets
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `amount` - (Required) (Updatable) The amount of the budget expressed as a whole number in the currency of the customer's rate card. 
* `budget_processing_period_start_offset` - (Optional) (Updatable) The number of days offset from the first day of the month, at which the budget processing period starts. In months that have fewer days than this value, processing will begin on the last day of that month. For example, for a value of 12, processing starts every month on the 12th at midnight.
* `compartment_id` - (Required) The OCID of the compartment.
* `defined_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{"Operations.CostCenter": "42"}` 
* `description` - (Optional) (Updatable) The description of the budget.
* `display_name` - (Optional) (Updatable) The displayName of the budget. Avoid entering confidential information.
* `freeform_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{"Department": "Finance"}` 
* `processing_period_type` - (Optional) (Updatable) The type of the budget processing period. Valid values are INVOICE and MONTH. 
* `reset_period` - (Required) (Updatable) The reset period for the budget. Valid value is MONTHLY.
* `target_compartment_id` - (Optional) This is DEPRECATED. Set the target compartment ID in targets instead. 
* `target_type` - (Optional) The type of target on which the budget is applied. 
* `targets` - (Optional) The list of targets on which the budget is applied. If targetType is "COMPARTMENT", the targets contain the list of compartment OCIDs. If targetType is "TAG", the targets contain the list of cost tracking tag identifiers in the form of "{tagNamespace}.{tagKey}.{tagValue}". Curerntly, the array should contain exactly one item. 


** IMPORTANT **
Any change to a property that does not support update will force the destruction and recreation of the resource with the new property values

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `actual_spend` - The actual spend in currency for the current budget cycle.
* `alert_rule_count` - The total number of alert rules in the budget.
* `amount` - The amount of the budget, expressed in the currency of the customer's rate card. 
* `budget_processing_period_start_offset` - The number of days offset from the first day of the month, at which the budget processing period starts. In months that have fewer days than this value, processing will begin on the last day of that month. For example, for a value of 12, processing starts every month on the 12th at midnight.
* `compartment_id` - The OCID of the compartment.
* `defined_tags` - Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{"Operations.CostCenter": "42"}` 
* `description` - The description of the budget.
* `display_name` - The display name of the budget. Avoid entering confidential information.
* `forecasted_spend` - The forecasted spend in currency by the end of the current budget cycle.
* `freeform_tags` - Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see [Resource Tags](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm).  Example: `{"Department": "Finance"}` 
* `id` - The OCID of the budget.
* `processing_period_type` - The type of the budget processing period. Valid values are INVOICE and MONTH. 
* `reset_period` - The reset period for the budget. 
* `state` - The current state of the budget.
* `target_compartment_id` - This is DEPRECATED. For backwards compatability, the property is populated when the targetType is "COMPARTMENT", and targets contain the specific target compartment OCID. For all other scenarios, this property will be left empty. 
* `target_type` - The type of target on which the budget is applied. 
* `targets` - The list of targets on which the budget is applied. If the targetType is "COMPARTMENT", the targets contain the list of compartment OCIDs. If the targetType is "TAG", the targets contain the list of cost tracking tag identifiers in the form of "{tagNamespace}.{tagKey}.{tagValue}". 
* `time_created` - The time that the budget was created.
* `time_spend_computed` - The time that the budget spend was last computed.
* `time_updated` - The time that the budget was updated.
* `version` - The version of the budget. Starts from 1 and increments by 1.

## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/oci/latest/docs/guides/changing_timeouts) for certain operations:
	* `create` - (Defaults to 20 minutes), when creating the Budget
	* `update` - (Defaults to 20 minutes), when updating the Budget
	* `delete` - (Defaults to 20 minutes), when destroying the Budget


## Import

Budgets can be imported using the `id`, e.g.

```
$ terraform import oci_budget_budget.test_budget "id"
```
