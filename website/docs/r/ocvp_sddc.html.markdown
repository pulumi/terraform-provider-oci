# oci_ocvp_sddc
This resource provides the Sddc resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Oracle Cloud VMware Solution service.

Creates an Oracle Cloud VMware Solution software-defined data center (SDDC).

Use the [WorkRequest](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/vmware/20200501/WorkRequest/) operations to track the
creation of the SDDC.

**Important:** You must configure the SDDC's networking resources with the security rules detailed in [Security Rules for Oracle Cloud VMware Solution SDDCs](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/VMware/Reference/ocvssecurityrules.htm). Otherwise, provisioning the SDDC will fail. The rules are based on the requirements set by VMware.

* `vsphere_vlan_id` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the VLAN used by the SDDC for the vSphere component of the VMware environment.

	This attribute is not guaranteed to reflect the vSphere VLAN currently used by the ESXi hosts in the SDDC. The purpose of this attribute is to show the vSphere VLAN that the Oracle Cloud VMware Solution will use for any new ESXi hosts that you *add to this SDDC in the future* with [CreateEsxiHost](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/vmware/20200501/EsxiHost/CreateEsxiHost).

	Therefore, if you change the existing ESXi hosts in the SDDC to use a different VLAN for the vSphere component of the VMware environment, you should use [UpdateSddc](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/api/#/en/vmware/20200501/Sddc/UpdateSddc) to update the SDDC's `vsphereVlanId` with that new VLAN's OCID. 
* `workload_network_cidr` - The CIDR block for the IP addresses that VMware VMs in the SDDC use to run application workloads. 

## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/oci/latest/docs/guides/changing_timeouts) for certain operations:
	* `create` - (Defaults to 6 hours), when creating the Sddc
	* `update` - (Defaults to 20 minutes), when updating the Sddc
	* `delete` - (Defaults to 20 minutes), when destroying the Sddc


## Import

Sddcs can be imported using the `id`, e.g.

```
$ terraform import oci_ocvp_sddc.test_sddc "id"
```
