## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `admin_password` - (Optional) The password for the administrative user. The password must be between 8 and 32 characters long, and must contain at least 1 numeric character, 1 lowercase character, 1 uppercase character, and 1 special (nonalphanumeric) character. 
* `admin_username` - (Optional) The username for the administrative user.
* `availability_domain` - (Required) The availability domain on which to deploy the Read/Write endpoint. This defines the preferred primary instance.

	In a failover scenario, the Read/Write endpoint is redirected to one of the other availability domains and the MySQL instance in that domain is promoted to the primary instance. This redirection does not affect the IP address of the DB System in any way.

	For a standalone DB System, this defines the availability domain in which the DB System is placed. 
* `backup_policy` - (Optional) (Updatable) Backup policy as optionally used for DB System Creation. 
	* `defined_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Usage of predefined tag keys. These predefined keys are scoped to namespaces.

		Tags defined here will be copied verbatim as tags on the Backup resource created by this BackupPolicy.

		Example: `{"foo-namespace.bar-key": "value"}` 
	* `freeform_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Simple key-value pair applied without any predefined name, type or scope. Exists for cross-compatibility only.

		Tags defined here will be copied verbatim as tags on the Backup resource created by this BackupPolicy.

		Example: `{"bar-key": "value"}` 
	* `is_enabled` - (Optional) (Updatable) Specifies if automatic backups are enabled. 
	* `pitr_policy` - (Optional) (Updatable) The PITR policy for the DB System.
		* `is_enabled` - (Required) (Updatable) Specifies if PITR is enabled or disabled.
	* `retention_in_days` - (Optional) (Updatable) Number of days to retain an automatic backup.
	* `window_start_time` - (Optional) (Updatable) The start of a 30-minute window of time in which daily, automated backups occur.

		This should be in the format of the "Time" portion of an RFC3339-formatted timestamp. Any second or sub-second time data will be truncated to zero.

		At some point in the window, the system may incur a brief service disruption as the backup is performed. 
* `compartment_id` - (Required) The OCID of the compartment.
* `configuration_id` - (Optional) The OCID of the Configuration to be used for this DB System.
* `crash_recovery` - (Optional) (Updatable) Whether to run the DB System with InnoDB Redo Logs and the Double Write Buffer enabled or disabled, and whether to enable or disable syncing of the Binary Logs. 
* `data_storage_size_in_gb` - (Optional) Initial size of the data volume in GBs that will be created and attached. Keep in mind that this only specifies the size of the database data volume, the log volume for the database will be scaled appropriately with its shape. It is required if you are creating a new database. It cannot be set if you are creating a database from a backup.
* `defined_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Usage of predefined tag keys. These predefined keys are scoped to namespaces. Example: `{"foo-namespace.bar-key": "value"}` 
* `deletion_policy` - (Optional) (Updatable) Policy for how the DB System and related resources should be handled at the time of its deletion. 
	* `automatic_backup_retention` - (Optional) (Updatable) Specifies if any automatic backups created for a DB System should be retained or deleted when the DB System is deleted. 
	* `final_backup` - (Optional) (Updatable) Specifies whether or not a backup is taken when the DB System is deleted. REQUIRE_FINAL_BACKUP: a backup is taken if the DB System is deleted. SKIP_FINAL_BACKUP: a backup is not taken if the DB System is deleted. 
	* `is_delete_protected` - (Optional) (Updatable) Specifies whether the DB System can be deleted. Set to true to prevent deletion, false (default) to allow. 
* `description` - (Optional) (Updatable) User-provided data about the DB System.
* `display_name` - (Optional) (Updatable) The user-friendly name for the DB System. It does not have to be unique.
* `fault_domain` - (Optional) The fault domain on which to deploy the Read/Write endpoint. This defines the preferred primary instance.

	In a failover scenario, the Read/Write endpoint is redirected to one of the other fault domains and the MySQL instance in that domain is promoted to the primary instance. This redirection does not affect the IP address of the DB System in any way.

	For a standalone DB System, this defines the fault domain in which the DB System is placed. 
* `freeform_tags` - (Optional) (Updatable) Simple key-value pair applied without any predefined name, type or scope. Exists for cross-compatibility only. Example: `{"bar-key": "value"}` 
* `hostname_label` - (Optional) The hostname for the primary endpoint of the DB System. Used for DNS.

	The value is the hostname portion of the primary private IP's fully qualified domain name (FQDN) (for example, "dbsystem-1" in FQDN "dbsystem-1.subnet123.vcn1.oraclevcn.com").

	Must be unique across all VNICs in the subnet and comply with RFC 952 and RFC 1123. 
* `ip_address` - (Optional) The IP address the DB System is configured to listen on. A private IP address of your choice to assign to the primary endpoint of the DB System. Must be an available IP address within the subnet's CIDR. If you don't specify a value, Oracle automatically assigns a private IP address from the subnet. This should be a "dotted-quad" style IPv4 address. 
* `is_highly_available` - (Optional) (Updatable) Specifies if the DB System is highly available.

	When creating a DB System with High Availability, three instances are created and placed according to your region- and subnet-type. The secondaries are placed automatically in the other two availability or fault domains.  You can choose the preferred location of your primary instance, only. 
* `maintenance` - (Optional) (Updatable) The Maintenance Policy for the DB System. `maintenance` and `backup_policy` cannot be updated in the same request.
	* `window_start_time` - (Required) (Updatable) The start of the 2 hour maintenance window.

		This string is of the format: "{day-of-week} {time-of-day}".

		"{day-of-week}" is a case-insensitive string like "mon", "tue", &c.

		"{time-of-day}" is the "Time" portion of an RFC3339-formatted timestamp. Any second or sub-second time data will be truncated to zero. 
* `port` - (Optional) The port for primary endpoint of the DB System to listen on.
* `port_x` - (Optional) The TCP network port on which X Plugin listens for connections. This is the X Plugin equivalent of port.

* `source` - (Optional) Parameters detailing how to provision the initial data of the system. 
	* `backup_id` - (Required when source_type=BACKUP) The OCID of the backup to be used as the source for the new DB System. 
	* `db_system_id` - (Required when source_type=PITR) The OCID of the DB System from which a backup shall be selected to be restored when creating the new DB System. Use this together with recovery point to perform a point in time recovery operation. 
	* `recovery_point` - (Applicable when source_type=PITR) The date and time, as per RFC 3339, of the change up to which the new DB System shall be restored to, using a backup and logs from the original DB System. In case no point in time is specified, then this new DB System shall be restored up to the latest change recorded for the original DB System. 
	* `source_type` - (Required) The specific source identifier. Use `BACKUP` for creating a new database by restoring from a backup.
* `subnet_id` - (Required) The OCID of the subnet the DB System is associated with. 
* `state` - (Optional) (Updatable) The target state for the DB System. Could be set to `ACTIVE` or `INACTIVE`. 
* `shutdown_type` - (Optional) It is applicable only for stopping a DB System. Could be set to `FAST`, `SLOW` or `IMMEDIATE`. Default value is `FAST`.
